# OrderFlowNode

OrderFlowNode is a project designed to create a Node.js server facilitating communication between three distinct sites. The primary objective is to establish a seamless order processing system reminiscent of the McDonald's model. The first site serves as the point of order initiation, transmitting requests to the second site. Subsequently, the third site displays and manages the processed orders.

This project is ideal for businesses or entities looking to implement an efficient and structured order management system, particularly in the context of multi-stage processes like those found in popular fast-food chains. OrderFlowNode aims to streamline the ordering experience and enhance overall operational efficiency.
